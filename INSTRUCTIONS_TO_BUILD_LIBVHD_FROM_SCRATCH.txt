Download source code tag.gz file from https://github.com/libyal/libvhdi/releases, make sure it has all libraries like libcstring etc. Do not download just git repository or "sorce code" link, they don't include all libraries and require executing multiple scripts, some of which don't run on Windows.

Delete everything in libvhdi_64bit git folder on local drive except .git subfolder, .gitignore, and.gitattributes

Extract the archve containg source code there. It usually extracts in something like libvhdi-20140608 sub-folder. Move contents of that folder into top level git libvhdi_64bit folder

Open project in VS2010 and let it convert the solution

Remove dokan, pyvhdi, and vhdimount projects from the solution

At this point you should be able to build the 32-bit libvhdi solution

Run both 64-bit conversion scripts as described in 
https://github.com/libyal/libvhdi/wiki/Building

At this point you should be able to build the 64-bit libvhdi solution

Now need to modify where libraries are being stored after build. By default all output is stored in /Release folder so when you build a 32-bit library and then build a 64-bit library, the 32-bit binaries get overwritten. We need to modify where the 64-bit binaries get stored.

Select the "x64" configuration in VS. Then for each project in libvhdi solution:
- right click on the project, select properties
- in "configuration:" pull-down menu select "All configurations"
- Select "Configuration Properties" -> "General"
- Change "Output directory" from "$(SolutionDir)$(Configuration)\" to "$(SolutionDir)$(Platform)\$(Configuration)"
Repeat these steps for all VS projects in the libvhdi solution

In order to be used with TSK the user needs to define an environment LIBVHDI_HOME variable pointed at the top level folder where this repository will be checked out to.

For example, if this repository is checked out into C:\cygwin64\home\user_name\libvhdi_64bit then LIBVHDI_HOME = C:\cygwin64\home\user_name\libvhdi_64bit
